I wanted to make a game about trying to describe something illusory.
The struggle to convey a thought, a sensation, or any vague idea.
I often find that the in the journey to represent something, 
there will always be some change in translation.  It is also 
inevitable that the original inspiration will irreversibly change, 
turning the whole practice into a sort of soft dissection.  It is a
process that can require great strength, while demanding to be 
held with reverence.
It seems like this is something we never really get away from, whether
we know it or not. I hope to show the way we might pursue this over 
our lives, at different ages, and with different amounts of luck.

I hope you find it worth your time :)
